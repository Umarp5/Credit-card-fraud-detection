# Credit-card-fraud-detection

The aim of this project is to create an accurate machine-learning method to identify fraudulent 
credit card transactions. Identifying fraud is an important challenge because fraudulent 
transactions make up a small percentage of total transactions, making classification difficult. 
The goal is to detect inconsistencies in transactional data to avoid fraud and maintain the 
integrity of financial systems.
 In this project, we will analyse different classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, k
nearest neighbours (k-NN), Random forest, and XGBoost. These models will be tested on the 
dataset, which will be created using resampling methods such as random under-sampling, 
Tomek links, and Edited Nearest Neighbours.
 The performance of these models will be measured using accuracy, recall, F1 score, and AUC
ROC metrics, with the goal of minimising false negatives, because it would be problematic for 
banks and other financial institutions if they were to miss fraudulent transactions. The goal of 
this research is to create a system that accurately detects fraud through data preprocessing, 
using features and model optimisation, even if only a small part of the dataset is made up of 
fraudulent transactions.
 Specific Objective(s)
 • Objective 1: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
 Prepare the dataset by cleaning, normalising, encoding categorical variables, and 
looking at missing values to ensure high-quality input for the machine learning 
models. In addition, fix any problems with the dataset such as under sampling to fix 
the imbalances in the dataset.
 • Objective 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyse the dataset to find trends, 
correlations, and distributions. Then focus on how different features such as 
transaction amounts, user demographics, and credit scores connect to the detection 
of fraud.
 • Objective 3: Model Training and Evaluation:
 Train and test the different machine learning models on the dataset, using the 
datasets, and evaluate performance using appropriate metrics such as precision, 
recall, and F1 score.
 • Objective 4: Visualisation of Results: Create visualisations that show, model 
performance comparisons and the effectiveness of different classification 
approaches for fraud detection
